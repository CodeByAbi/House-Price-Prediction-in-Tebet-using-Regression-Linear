# House Price Prediction in Tebet using Linear Regression
This project focuses on predicting house prices in the Tebet area using linear regression. The objective is to analyze various factors influencing property values and develop a model that can accurately estimate house prices based on these factors.

# **Project Overview**

The real estate market in Tebet is dynamic and influenced by multiple variables such as location, size, age of the property, and amenities. By leveraging linear regression techniques, this project aims to uncover patterns and relationships within the data, providing valuable insights for potential buyers, sellers, and real estate investors.

# **Key Features**
1. Data Collection from Kaggle
Gathering relevant data on house prices and influencing factors from reliable sources.

2. Data Pre-Processing
Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

3. Data Exploration
Visualizing data distributions and relationships between variables to gain initial insights.

5. Data Modelling
